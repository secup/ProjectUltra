# ProjectUltra Change Log

This log tracks all bug fixes and behavioral changes to prevent re-doing work due to lost context.

**Format:** Each entry must include:
1. What was broken (symptom + root cause)
2. What was changed (files, code)
3. How it's properly fixed (why it works, invariants)
4. Test verification (command + expected output)

## 2026-01-27: IWaveform Interface Documentation

**What was done:**
- Created comprehensive documentation for refactoring reference

**Files created:**
- `docs/MODEM_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete ModemEngine analysis
- `docs/DUAL_CHIRP_CFO_ANALYSIS.md` - CFO detection and position handling
- `docs/TESTING_METHODOLOGY.md` - Test tools and requirements

**Why it matters:**
- ModemEngine has two parallel code paths (old direct modulators, new IWaveform)
- RxPipeline integration has bugs - old `processRxBuffer_*` methods still work
- CFO must be applied via Hilbert transform, not simple multiplication

## 2026-01-27: OFDM_CHIRP Support in test_iwaveform

**What was broken:**
- test_iwaveform.cpp could not decode OFDM_CHIRP frames
- ModemEngine's acquisition thread routes ALL chirp frames to MC-DPSK decoder
- OFDMChirpWaveform::process() only returned 648 soft bits instead of all

**What was changed:**
- `tools/test_iwaveform.cpp`: Added `decodeOFDMChirpFrame()` that uses IWaveform directly
- `tools/test_iwaveform.cpp`: Added `setConnectWaveform()` call for TX (connect_waveform_ is used for disconnected mode TX, not waveform_mode_)
- `src/waveform/ofdm_chirp_waveform.cpp`: Fixed `process()` to loop and retrieve ALL soft bits from demodulator

**How it's properly fixed:**
- OFDM_CHIRP decode bypasses ModemEngine and uses IWaveform directly
- TX uses `setConnectWaveform(mode)` in addition to `setWaveformMode(mode)`
- `process()` now calls `demodulator_->getSoftBits()` in a loop until `hasPendingData()` returns false

**Test verification:**
```bash
./test_iwaveform --snr 17 --cfo 30 --channel awgn -w ofdm_chirp --frames 10
# Expected: 100% decode rate
```

**Commit:** `84bb563 Add OFDM_CHIRP support to test_iwaveform with CFO correction`

## 2026-01-27: MC-DPSK CFO Correction for Training/Reference Samples

**What was broken:**
- MC-DPSK decode failed with CFO on fading channels
- Training and reference samples were receiving UNCORRECTED signal
- `processTraining()` was estimating wrong residual CFO

**What was changed:**
- `src/psk/multi_carrier_dpsk.hpp`: CFO correction applied to training/ref samples BEFORE `processTraining()`
- Added public `applyCFO()` wrapper method that preserves `cfo_hz_` after correction

**How it's properly fixed:**
- CFO correction must happen BEFORE `processTraining()`, not after
- The demodulator's `applyCFOCorrection()` resets `cfo_hz_` to 0, so we save/restore it
- Chirp CFO is trusted over training CFO (more accurate from 1+ second signal)

**Invariants:**
1. CFO from chirp detection is the most accurate - trust it
2. Apply CFO to ALL samples (training, ref, data) before demodulation
3. Don't let `processTraining()` overwrite chirp CFO estimate

**Test verification:**
```bash
./test_iwaveform --snr 10 --cfo 30 --channel moderate -w mc_dpsk --frames 10
# Expected: 100% decode rate
```

**Commit:** `48e6271 Fix MC-DPSK CFO correction for training/reference samples`

## 2026-01-26: Complex Correlation for CFO-Tolerant Chirp Detection

**What was broken:**
- Real-valued chirp correlation oscillated at CFO beat frequency
- Detection position varied with CFO (±24-48 samples error)
- CFO estimation was inaccurate (~11.7 Hz for 20 Hz actual)

**What was changed:**
- `src/sync/chirp_sync.hpp`: Added cosine templates alongside sine templates
- `src/sync/chirp_sync.hpp`: New `computeComplexTemplateCorrelation()` returns magnitude √(I² + Q²)

**How it's properly fixed:**
- Complex correlation: I = Σ signal × cos(phase), Q = Σ signal × sin(phase)
- Magnitude √(I² + Q²) is CFO-invariant (phase rotation doesn't change magnitude)
- Peak position is now consistent regardless of CFO

**Invariants:**
1. Always use complex correlation for chirp detection
2. Dual chirp gap timing gives CFO estimate (up shifts left, down shifts right)
3. Position correction: `true_pos = detected_pos + CFO × 10`

**Test verification:**
```bash
./test_iwaveform --snr 5 --cfo 50 --channel awgn -w mc_dpsk --frames 10
# Expected: 100% decode rate
```

## 2026-01-26: OFDM_CHIRP CFO - Trust Chirp Estimate

**What was broken:**
- OFDM_CHIRP decode failed with CFO
- Training symbol CFO estimation was overwriting correct chirp CFO
- Training was measuring carrier phase advance (wrong metric)

**What was changed:**
- `src/ofdm/demodulator_impl.hpp`: Added `chirp_cfo_estimated` flag
- Flag is set when `setFrequencyOffset()` is called
- `processPresynced()` trusts chirp CFO instead of re-estimating from training

**How it's properly fixed:**
- When chirp-based CFO is available, skip training-based re-estimation
- Training-based CFO is less accurate (100ms vs 1+ second signal)
- The `toBaseband()` function applies CFO correction before FFT

**Invariants:**
1. Chirp CFO > Training CFO in accuracy
2. Set `chirp_cfo_estimated = true` when CFO comes from chirp detection
3. Apply CFO in `toBaseband()` before FFT

**Test verification:**
```bash
./test_iwaveform --snr 17 --cfo 50 --channel awgn -w ofdm_chirp --frames 10
# Expected: 100% decode rate
```
